[**Take our short two question survey**](https://forms.gle/PHjggWfvQXob6TbF7), we would greatly appreciate it!

**Reminder:** If you're modding a sega mini, the included USB cable will not work.

**Attention:** Hakchi2 CE 3.8 only works with RetroArch 1.8.4 Xtreme or later, you must also update the cores.

If you have any problems using hakchi2 ce, we recommend you join our discord server.
